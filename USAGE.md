# PyTorch Silencer - Usage Guide

This simplified release provides only the graphical interface.

## Quick Start

Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Use the **Training** tab to create a model from your transcripts, then use
**Process Transcript** to mark silences for removal. The **Audio Silencer** tab
can cut a video using a processed transcript that contains `[SILENCE-CUT]`
markers.
