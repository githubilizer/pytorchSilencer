[9.56 -> 9.60] 
[9.60 -> 9.78] take
[9.78 -> 9.80] 
[9.80 -> 9.90] a

[10.66 -> 11.08] down-to-earth
[11.08 -> 11.08] 
[11.08 -> 11.40] approach
[11.40 -> 11.56] 
[11.56 -> 11.70] to

[14.42 -> 14.64] 
[14.64 -> 14.90] So,
[14.90 -> 14.92] 
[14.92 -> 15.30] starting

[15.32 -> 15.48] off,
[15.48 -> 15.48] 
[15.48 -> 15.62] we'll
[15.62 -> 15.64]

[18.42 -> 18.56] 
[18.56 -> 18.86] Russia
[18.86 -> 18.90]

[28.04 -> 28.32] day.
[28.32 -> 28.48] 
[28.48 -> 28.64] Then
[28.64 -> 28.64] 
[28.64 -> 28.80] there's
[28.80 -> 28.82] 
[28.82 -> 28.94] for

[35.50 -> 35.52] 
[35.52 -> 35.82] we'll
[35.82 -> 35.82] 
[35.82 -> 36.06] take
