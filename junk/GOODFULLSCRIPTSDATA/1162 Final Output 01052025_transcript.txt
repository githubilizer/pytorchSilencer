Day 1,162 of the Ukrainian war map, also known as the Russo-Ukrainian War. Jossie here, and today is another update as I take a simplified and down-to-earth approach to some of the most important happenings on the ground in Ukraine. So, starting off, we'll take a look at those Russian losses, as currently, Russia sits on more than 951,000 military personnel losses, representing an additional 1,100 in the past day. Then as for hardware, one tank, one APV, 11 artillery, and one rocket launcher, plus 179 soft targets. Very few armored vehicles to speak of today, just before a large list of international leaders are expected to grace Moscow with their attendance in this year's May 9th military parade in the Red Square, something that Russia is said to be gearing up for, to put on a real show this year, that is to say, more than one tank. But how does this relate to today's stats? Well, it almost leaves one feeling like Russia's armed forces have to choose between resource extraction as a means for prepping a 45-minute military parade as an alternative to using their equipment in the SMO. It's a loose connection, fair enough, but surely exists at some level, still. Then, headed into the map, as Ukraine has struck deep into Russian territory, into the Murom instrument building plant in the Vladimir Oblast, approximately 300 kilometers east of Moscow, and some 700 kilometers from Ukraine. The facility, known locally as the Powder Factory, is a critical component of Russia's military-industrial complex, producing ignition devices for ammunition and other components. According to a source from the SBU, Ukraine's security service, the drone strike ignited a fire spanning 720 square meters, and damaged two buildings, including a storage facility. Governor Oleksandr Avdeev of the Vladimir region confirmed the incident, and did in fact refer to drone activity as being the cause. Now, due to some unquestionably gaping wide open holes in Russian airspace, Ukraine appears to be picking back up where it left off on conducting precision strikes deep within Russian territory, challenging the Kremlin's sense of security far from the front lines. It should also be noted here that the Murom plant's inclusion on an international sanctions list due to the SMO does go a long way to highlight its strategic importance to Russia's military efforts as well. Then, headed across to Rylsk of the Kursk region, and for the type of explosion you don't see every day, containing splashes of blue sparks. Not a lot is known so far on the event, but the flames' and sparks' colors suggest metals like copper and aluminum, common in military equipment, or resulting from an infrastructure site, like that of power lines or transformers. Now, moving across to Volgograd, or should we say Stalingrad, as Putin has signed a decree granting the Volgograd International Airport as the international historical name of Stalingrad. Now, Volgograd, once known as Stalingrad, went through a process of de-Stalinization in the 1960s, aimed to erase Stalin's legacy due to his brutal policies, including purges and famines, and the general living under horrendous conditions. But now, Russia appears to be re-invigorating the ghost of its past, rewinding the clock, reviving the name, and devolving back into the nostalgia of the old ways. Not a fantastic direction to head in. Then on the map, and back to Kursk for a moment, where a tidy little propaganda reel just dropped North Korean soldiers, filmed at one of the regional bases, capturing themselves in crisp uniforms, mid-training, and lounging in spotless quarters. What was once denied on Russia's use of DPRK soldiers is now flat-out paraded around. But the real brain twist hits when North Korean Lieutenant General Pak Yong-Il steps in. He calls his soldiers' involvement in the SMO as a new chapter in the DPRK-Russia combat partnership, and even goes as far as to frame the so-called liberation of Kursk as, quote, "A victory over justice and pure evil." Gee, how do you respond to something like that? If someone is cheering alongside North Korea and calling that justice against pure evil, then somewhere along the line, the compass flipped completely upside down. Then, headed close enough by on the map, straight to Kupiansk in the northeastern sector. Now seeing occasional high temperatures of 24 degrees Celsius, or 75 degrees Fahrenheit, but by no means a beautiful day for some, because due to the combat work of UAV operators of the Nebesna Mara unit, from the AFU's 43rd Mechanized Brigade, alongside use of cluster munition shells, a Russian attack light on armor, heavier on infantry, was devastatingly repelled in the region. Infantrymen who could flee were seen running away from their damaged vehicles. And it all somehow acts as a reminder of the AFU's drone rankings coming in every month, with, for example, a very neck-and-neck race of friendly competition between the Lazaar Group and the Birds of Magyar Units in the top two division placements, with points awarded per month based on successful strikes on enemy targets. Collectively, all units are pushing a staggeringly whopping 70 to 80,000 hits per month. And given that this is a competition, they have to submit the visual proof for it as well. Then, headed further down the map into the greater region surrounding Toretsk, where after some elements of Russia's 8th CAA, Combined Arms Army, joined the fray in early March, possibly even earlier-Latest results overnight indicated their forward movements just beyond Sukhabalka, and also headed into the direction of the outer settlement of Dachna from Koretsk itself, making some small gains at these two locations. Then headed across to the liberated Kherson region, and for a change, to see where demining efforts continue on this front, with sappers receiving vital support from the likes of a GCS 200, which is a Swiss designed, German built mine clearing vehicle supplied to Ukraine, as it plays a role in demining the most mined country on the planet. Then further into Ukrainian territory, as overnight, both Kharkiv and Dnipro were struck as Russian missiles and drones hit homes and civilian infrastructure. In Kharkiv, three Iskander missiles caused significant damage to some apartment blocks, with over 20 high rises subjected to the blasts. And all of this as the Kremlin calls for an early May ceasefire, alongside their constant rhetoric of looking for peace. It makes little sense. Then headed further afield on the map today, Russia reportedly is expanding its military infrastructure along the Finnish border, stockpiling tanks for what's perceived to be a potential future aggression against a NATO member. It's also known that Russian authorities are also reviving the national security strategy to reflect President Putin's broader territorial ambitions in Europe, justifying outgoing efforts to prepare for conflict, as opposed to any means to de-escalate tensions internationally. Now, headed across to some news to Washington, where the clock is ticking on diplomacy. US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has issued a sharp ultimatum. If neither Moscow or Kiev puts forward peace proposals soon, the US will exit talks altogether. "The window for progress is narrowing," Rubio said, stressing the urgency for meaningful steps towards a ceasefire. Echoing that urgency, US diplomat, Tammy Bruce, described the coming days as critical for peace in Ukraine. She threw support behind Ukrainian official, Andrii Sibiy's call for an immediate truce, questioning Putin's offer of a May 8th to May 10th ceasefire. With the common sentiment now expressed by Ukrainian officials on this latest Putin proposed short term ceasefire, is that if it's truly humanitarian, and if it's in the name of peace, why wait 10 days? Why not start proceedings now? It's difficult to make sense of waiting it out only to culminate in a meaningless Victory Day parade or 72 hour ceasefire, that Russia would, as seen during its own Easter proposed ceasefire, simply use it to regroup, rotate in and out, and lay foundations for intense post ceasefire attacks. The writing's already on the wall for as to how they respond to these short breaks, using them to their advantage militarily, but still violating them on, albeit a smaller scale. And so, as for this latest news update, the message out of DC is tightening. Talks must now turn into terms, otherwise, time for the US to withdraw. Which may amount to the US stopping the stop to Ukrainian military aid, and stopping the stop to further Russian sanctions. Sometimes it's good when things stop. Meanwhile, in a pointed rebuke of Moscow's wartime narrative, US Special Envoy Keith Kellogg stated during a keynote address at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, that Russia is not winning this war, quote unquote, citing their lack of significant territorial gains over the past 18 months. Speaking yesterday, Kellogg emphasized that Russian forces have failed to capture Kiev, they haven't crossed west of the Dnipro River, and still haven't taken Odessa, despite suffering massive troop losses. "They move by the meters, not miles," he said. Which is a nicely worded cross pollination of the imperial and metric systems, I might add. As he said these words highlighting Ukraine's determined defense on home soil, Kellogg also dismissed President Putin's offer of a three day ceasefire as absurd, reaffirming that the US is focused on achieving a full and lasting peace, not a temporary pause. Then headed across to some hardware news. This one's an interesting piece, as Ukraine's DELTA system, a battlefield management platform, built for real time command, control and coordination is now drawing NATO's attention and interest. At least one member is reportedly moving to procure it, although who that is has not been publicly disclosed. The battlefield management platform, designed from the ground up, from the trench up, where it puts drones, live maps, and targeting intel straight into the hands of frontline troops via phone, tablet or laptops. Its backbone comprises of two core modules that stitches together surveillance and precision strike data on the fly. Last year, it passed a NATO security audit as well, with experts calling it closer to the Pentagon's CJADAC2, Combined-Joint All Domain Command and Control, than anything else that the West has deployed. So it's battlefield tech that can be considered cutting edge in the domain of situational awareness, but unlike the CJADAC2 that's still in development, this Ukrainian platform is running in real active battlefront conditions. Then headed across to news inside of Russia, just to see how things are going on that side of the fence, where some recent news showed that a Russian journalist has slipped out from under house arrest and into hiding.Ekaterina Barabash, arrested earlier this year for daring to speak out against the war in Ukraine, has escaped, with Russian state media confirming she's now officially wanted by police. Meanwhile, a brutal sentence was handed down last week to a 19-year-old Russian student, Darya Kozyreva, who was punished with nearly three years in prison, all for taping poems by Ukrainian national poet, Taras Shevchenko, to his own monument in Russia on the anniversary of the SMO invasion. In her final statement to the court, Darya didn't back down, claiming Ukrainian land still to be occupied by Russia and that Moscow has not managed to conquer Ukraine. And so there we have it, another example of an oppressive regime, not just internationally, but domestically, the country that jails its poets and hunts its journalists and still dares to proclaim it wants peace. Then speaking of the peace that Russia wants, to a quick and partially amusing piece to round off the video with this one, as Russians really want Odesa. They want it like the bee wants the nectar, the cat wants the cream. And this case is no different, as Putin's presidential aide, Patrushev, specifically noted that Odesa city spent over two centuries as the Russian empire's and the Soviet Union's outpost in the Black Sea and claimed that Odesa city residents have nothing in common with the current Ukrainian government. Yeah, well, tell that to the residents of Odesa. It's a wonder how much authority that Patrushev can speak on of the matter being so far away in the halls of the Kremlin dynasty, and where Patrushev was also reported to be discussing plans to take Odesa through referendum. Fancy that. Performing the most illegitimate of referendums from afar, and during time of war, surely amounting to a landslide victory for Russian annexation, followed by writing Odesa into their constitution just like the rest, for what once seemed so far-fetched is oddly now a possibility. But Patrushev's eyes are far bigger than his stomach, because Odesa is really considered a bridge too far for the Russian army, especially given those bridges are no longer stable, active, or even exist across the Dnieper River, not to mention there's two additional Ukrainian regions to pass to get to it. Good luck with that. So that's it for today, guys. Thanks again for watching. Please continue to like, comment, subscribe if not already, and I really always do appreciate that. Thanks for those that have already subscribed and stuck around, and I do hope to see all of you guys there in the next one. Cheers! (drums playing).
