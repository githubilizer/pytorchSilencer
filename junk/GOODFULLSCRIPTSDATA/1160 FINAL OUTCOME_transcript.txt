Day 1,060 of the Ukrainian war map, also known as the Russo-Ukrainian War. Jozzy here, and today is another update as I take a simplified and down-to-earth approach to some of the most important happenings on the ground in Ukraine. So, starting off, we'll take a look at those Russian losses, as currently, Russia sits on more than 949,000 military personnel losses, representing an additional 1,160 in the past day. Then as for hardware, four tanks, 13 APVs, 31 artillery, and a semi-respectable 105 soft targets. Now, as for those armored vehicles, Russia is digging deep into their armored reserves, and it's showing. New imagery confirms major bases, like the 6018th and the 943rd, are nearly empty, mostly scrap and cannibalized hulls left behind. Even old MT-LBs, trucks, and BTRs are being pulled out, equipment that sat untouched for years. These bases are major central storage depots built to house thousands of armored vehicles in reserve, with Russia only possessing about 10 to 12 existing at this scale. Apart from these two, the 904th in Bryansk is mostly emptied and scattered gear. The 1295th in Vladikavkaz has been drawn down heavily. Their 22nd Central Tank Reserve Base has dealt with large reductions. There is also their 5th Armored Base, very depleted, low on useful tanks. Their 47th Base, drained hard, especially after 2023 losses. And the list goes on. It points to a wider reality. The flow of replacement vehicles to the front isn't keeping pace with losses, forcing Russia to raid whatever's left in storage just to patch the gaps, a trend that's only accelerating as the war goes on. Then, headed to the map, where overnight, drones struck the Kremniy El microelectronics plant in Bryansk, a crucial facility for Russian military technology, and marks the fifth attack on the plant since the full-scale invasion began. However, most, if not all of that, was in the last nine months or so. Now, Kremniy El manufactures these chips and components for a variety of systems, including for cruise missiles, S-300 and S-400 air defense systems, and Iskander ballistic missiles. It's a facility that also produces parts for radar, electronic warfare systems, and even Russian drones. But once again, the regional heads of Russia are lost in denial, feeding the Russian MOD, which then boasted that its forces downed 119 Ukrainian drones overnight in these northern districts, neutralizing any threat. It's comments like these that speak more to the Kremlin's psychology than anything else, simply because they can rarely accept the reality that Ukrainian aerial strikes have outmatched their air defenses, leading to the all-too-often burying of their heads in the sand. Then, headed across to nearby Kursk, where destruction of a Russian mechanized convoy near Oleshnya was noted, compliments of the AFU's 80th Airborne Assault Brigade. Also seen in these parts, a Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 carried out an airstrike using several AASM Hammer strikes on an old sugar factory in Tyotkino, where Russian FPV drones and equipment were reportedly stored. Next, and for the wider Kursk axis, for what was a long and open secret is now official, because following yesterday's official Russian confirmation on the use of North Korean soldiers fighting against Ukraine, it's now gone further than that with Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, who calls it a sacred mission supplying his own troops in Russia to fight against Ukraine, and orders a monument in Pyongyang for his soldiers, calling an invoking of the defense pact with Russia. For Ukraine, it's a declaration of war by two nuclear powers, and proof that appeasement only breeds escalation, as North Korea's involvement, once tolerated as a distant threat from many parts of the globe, turns now into an open pact of war alongside Russia. Lucky for Ukraine, 12,000 DPRK soldiers didn't pose a significant threat. Even still, it remains to be seen what level of involvement North Korea will escalate to next. Then, finally, as it relates to Kursk itself, multiple Russian mil bloggers have called out Putin and Gerasimov's claims that Ukrainian forces are no longer in Kursk, calling the statements false, including from popular Russian Telegrammer WarGonzo. Now, some embraced the Kremlin narrative, while others opted to ignore Gerasimov's announcement, because as it's known, among Russian units fighting in Kursk, they all still say the same thing. Ukraine still operates in the region, and is a very hard fact to ignore for them. But let's say, even were Ukraine were to be completely ousted from this Russian territory, it by no means leads to an instant cessation of hostilities, but rather a continuation along the borders, with little opportunity provided for Russia to pack up and move to the eastern Donbas region. So, the underlying dynamic is more of a realization for the invading army that they are stuck guarding all of their northern borders for life now. Then, on the map, headed to Rostov, as something is burning as of just a couple of hours ago. It's unclear if there's something in the grass or if their vegetation is just burning wildly, something that the Rostov governor might normally announce. But the landscape does look striking,Now to swing across to the Ukrainian map. Uh, let's see. Starting in Luhansk, as Atesh partisans sabotaged another transformer cabinet on the railway, this time near Stanytsia Luhanska, not far from northeast occupied Luhansk City itself. Which is not far northeast of occupied Luhansk City itself. The sabotage operation disrupted Russian supply lines and led to delays in the delivery of equipment and spare parts as per Telegram statements made by Atesh. And you can see the Atesh calling card right there, poured over with a special liquid just before igniting. It would almost defeat the purpose of the calling card to do so. However, for this case, the Telegram message itself works as that calling card. The Atesh group also stated that more such strikes are coming soon and that they will continue to systematically strike the transport infrastructure used by the occupiers. They also called on more residents of temporarily occupied territories to join their movement. Then on the map, and closer to the front lines, Sumy in fact, where the brave heroic story of Ukraine's 1st Separate Tank Tversk Brigade of rescuing their own men unfolded. With the help of Ukrainian UAV operators, they freed three of their soldiers captured by the Russians. The Russian servicemen fled and later, with the help of drones, the rescued Ukrainians made it back to safe positions. That would've been a feelgood operation. Now, headed further southeast on the map, the enemy occupied Andriivka, also known as Nadezhdinka, taking about a square kilometer of land. Only 500,000 more to go. Next, we head to the Kinburn Spit in occupied Kherson where the Ukrainian Navy destroyed a Russian military vehicle and a dugout with personnel. In fact, the area has been quite heated recently with Russia looking to maintain control over the spit so as to avoid any Ukrainian SOF naval operations to establish a presence there. Now, to Crimea, because in follow-up to the closing of the Kerch Bridge, in this occupied peninsula, to coincide with Russia's May 9th Victory Day Parade, Putin has now taken things one step further, announcing a ceasefire between the 8th and the 10th, just like that, willy-nilly, in an attempt to avoid any embarrassment on the day related to aerial incursions that might affect the Red Square Parade event up in, uh, Moscow. So, it seems we're starting to see a pattern here of Putin outright declaring these tiny, bite-sized ceasefires that only seek to benefit him. Can it get any more obvious? And yet, ceasefires require talks, planning and agreements ahead of time that include robust security monitoring mechanisms instead of simply being dictated like this. You can already see the future for this one. Ukraine will likely take an entirely defensive posture on the day. Russia will use it to push into new territory. All the meanwhile, with Putin claiming violations from the Ukrainian side. Almost as if to suggest that Ukraine on those days is not allowed to defend itself. Then, headed across to some news for today. So, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that President Putin is prepared to agree to a ceasefire, just after Putin expressed willingness for an unconditional ceasefire yesterday. But with Lavrov comments now saying that Russia will do so on the conditions of arm supplies to Ukraine becoming stopped from Western suppliers and that the ceasefire is not to be used to strengthen the Ukrainian Army. Now, there is a lot to wrestle within these statements because firstly, of course, Russia expresses readiness for an unconditional ceasefire with conditions. It's the ultimate 3D chess move right there. Secondly, Russia expects Ukraine to not be subject to foreign military aid, which one would hope most can see that there is only one reason for that type of demand, so that Russia can dominate Ukraine on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Lavrov and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke over the phone, focusing on the Ukrainian crisis and the need to set up an environment that is amicable towards peace negotiations. Around the same time, Lavrov made separate statements, really a list of Kremlin demands to say that Ukraine renounce NATO membership and recognizing Russian control over all of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia. But also for Ukraine's demilitarization and the lifting of sanctions and Russia retaining control over the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant. It's a tall order of requests to say the least and in many parts is in opposition to a previous peace proposal provided by the US administration. At this juncture it's getting clear to see that Russia has been doubling down over the past two months or so now with these types of demands offering very little in the way of concessions and appears to have no immediate need for a true ceasefire or act in good faith as part of negotiations. Very much looking to be their way or the highway type of rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin right now. Then headed across to some hardware news as Ukraine is now producing enough 155 millimeter self-propelled howitzers every year to equip 24 battalions. With a standard battalion typically fielding around 18 howitzers that works out to a staggering 432 new howitzers per year as Ukraine factories have now reported to have ramped up to producing 36 Bohdana 155 millimeter SPGs every single month now. Almost doubling the now long reported figure of 18 to 20 produced per month, a level achieved up to October of last year. As such, Ukraine has effectively doubled their previous rate with all of it being done while Ukraine is under wartime conditions, highlighting Ukraine's industrial strength that they aren't just surviving war. They're building a serious military industry, proving they could out-build what many thought-They could only import. And it is interesting because Ukraine is out-producing Russia in these large-caliber howitzers by an incredibly large margin. It appears Russia might be capable of refurbishing 200 or 300 big guns from Soviet stockpiles each year, despite the lack of sustainability in that approach. But as for Russia's new SPG productions, it's unclear if they can consistently produce these in any meaningful numbers on an ongoing basis. Reason being, howitzers are complex. They're not just big tubes. They need precision engineering for accuracy, durability, and safety. But scaling that up month after month is a whole different battle all of its own, especially for the heavily sanctioned Russian motherland that lacks access to precision of machine tools and advanced materials needed to build modern systems at scale. Then to a quick 10-second Russian military mobilization blunder segment, as this is what happens when Russia digs deep to get the manpower it needs to continue its war. I present to you Russia's elite heading to the front line with many men seen here falling under Article 105 of Russia's Criminal Code, which covers the unlawful intentional causing of death to another person. It's clear these guys are coming from jail, and they are not part of anything that would constitute a professional army. Then heading across to an amusing Russian hardware segment to finish the video off today, as the Russians are at it again upgrading their finest military masterpiece, the UAZ Buhanka van. They have turned it into a battle-ready armored beast, slapping on extra metal sheets and tire scraps that'll make it a rolling bonfire the second a shell hits. And on the topic of rubber protections, like the one seen here, many have said that rubber is very difficult to ignite, making this a good idea, which is true on account of the rubber tires being difficult to ignite. But there is nuance because to get that rubber to reach very high temperatures to catch fire, you would need to almost be, let's say, in a war zone, getting shot at with shells, RPG-7s, or RPG warheads strapped to the belly of a drone, which happens to be exactly the location these rubberized monstrosities are headed off to, ripe conditions for getting that rubber to burn. And when it does, it's almost impossible to put out, which is why you've probably seen many endless tire storage pit fire jokes or references over the years. And so the irony here would largely be that where Russians are setting themselves up with nonstandard army vehicles using nonstandard protective measures, it's really the very last approach they should be taking given the direction they're headed in. So that's it for today, guys. Thanks again for watching. Please continue to like, comment. I'll see you all in the comments, and yeah, I do hope to see all of you guys there in the next one. Cheers!
